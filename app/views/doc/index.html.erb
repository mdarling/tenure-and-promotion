<h2>CAS Authentication</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>User logs in by UNM Net ID</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>Allows users to be automatically identified and registered by UNM Net ID</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>Redirects to UNM CAS to log in before allowing anybody to get into the application</li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>Uses RubyCAS rails, code for class
<pre>
class ApplicationController
  #Require CAS to log in.
  before_filter :cas_filter

  def cas_filter
    RubyCAS::Filter.filter(self)
  end
</pre></li></ul></li>
<li><h3>Allow external reviewers through</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>Allows external reviewers to log in without a Net ID</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>The CAS Redirection is not enabled for some pages, requiring a regular login instead</li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>RubyCAS is defined in a class, the class is escaped for certain pages</li>
<li>An external reviewer would be authenticated internally against a database
<pre>
# To skip the filter:
skip_before_filter :cas_filter</pre></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Role-based user registration</h2>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>These values are stored in a CSV files (departments.csv) as college,department</li>
<li>These can be pulled into the database for storage if it's preferable.</li></ul></li>
<li><h3>Users operate within their own scope</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>Users only see other users and files within their own scope</li>
<li>Users can attach files to users within their scope</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>Users are assigned to the Provost, College, Department, or Personal level</li>
<li>Users at the Provost level can see all files at the college level.</li>
<li>Users at the college level can see all files at the department level within their college</li>
<li>Users at the department level can see all files at the personal level within their department</li>
<li>Users at the personal level can see their own files</li>
<li>Users are assigned as follows:</li>
<li>Provost Level
<ul><li>Senior Vice Provost</li>
<li>Provost's Admin</li>
<li>Provost's Committee Faculty</li></ul></li>
<li>College Level
<ul><li>College Admin</li>

<li>Personal Level
<ul><li>Full Professor Candidate</li>
<li>Mid-Probationary Candidate</li>
<li>Tenure and Promotion Candidate</li>
<li>Tech User</li></ul></li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>The roles belonging to users in the User Registration are also constrained by this scope</li>
<li>Tech users cannot see anyone's files, even though they can register any user</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Dossier Creation and Categories</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Pre-defined Categories (can be reconfigured)</h3>

<h4>What it does</h4>

<ul><li>Categories are pre-defined for each candidate according to a convention</li></ul>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<ul><li>When a candidate is registered, categories are created for him or her.</li>
<li>The categories are as follows:</li>
<li>Curriculum Vitae</li>
<li>Teaching Statement</li>
<li>Research Statement</li>
<li>Teaching Record</li>
<li>Summary of Student Evaluations</li>
<li>Course Materials</li>
<li>External Reviews</li>
<li>Department Vote and Comments</li>
<li>Letter from Department Chair</li>
<li>College Committee Vote and Comments</li>
<li>Letter from Dean</li>
<li>Supplemental Materials</li>
<li>These categories will each have different users put files into them, but will all belong to a single candidate</li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>These are defined in a CSV file (categories.CSV)</li>
<li>They may be defined in a database instead if convenient</li>
<li>When a user is created, the following is called:
<pre>
if @user.save
  redirect_to users_path, notice: 'User was successfully created.'
  #Read the categories from the csv file
  categories=SmarterCSV.process('categories.csv')
  categories.each do |c|
    #Create the categories for the candidate
    @user.Categories.create(name: c[:categories])
  end
  Welcome.candidate_mail(recipient: @user).deliver
else
  #Go back to the page if error
  render :new
end
</pre></li></ul></li>
<li><h3>All files fit into a category, owned by a user</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>All files uploaded into a dossier for a candidate fit into a category</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>Multiple files may be uploaded to each category</li>
<li>Only users who own each category can upload to it</li>
<li>Category ownership is as follows:</li>
<li>Candidate:
<ul><li>Curriculum Vitae</li>
<li>Teaching Statement</li>
<li>Research Statement</li>
<li>Teaching Record</li>
<li>Summary of Student Evaluations</li>
<li>Course Materials</li>
<li>Supplemental Materials</li></ul></li>
<li>Department Admin
<ul><li>External Reviews</li>
<li>Department Vote and Comments</li>
<li>Letter from Department Chair</li></ul></li>
<li>College Admin
<ul><li>College Committee Vote and Comments</li>
<li>Letter from Dean</li></ul></li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>Each user will be able to see that all categories exist, but will be allowed access based on scope</li>
<li>There will have to be a system in which College Admins and Department Admins operate within the scope of a candidate to access candidates' categories</li></ul></li>
<li><h3>All files are converted into standard PDF</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>After being uploaded, all files that can be converted into a PDF will be converted into a PDF</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>After uploading files, the person who uploaded clicks a button, and the app converts them to PDF</li>
<li>This conversion is done by an external service called <a href="http://cloudconvert.org">CloudConvert</a>.</li>
<li>Files that can't be converted to PDF are stored in file storage and linked to from a PDF.</li>
<li>Each file is stored as an individual PDF</li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>This runs a loop and sends each file in the dossier to CloudConvert</li>
<li>After conversion is complete the app redownloads it</li>
<li>This must be done asynchronously, or the client will experience lag (that is the case now)</li>
<li>These raw files must either be deleted or secured after the conversion</li>
<li>Here's how it currently works:
<pre>
#This converts the files to PDF using CloudConvert.
def convert
  @user=current_user
  @categories=@user.Categories.each
  @categories.each do |category|
    category.Converts.each do |convert|
      #Purge all the old entries
      convert.destroy
    end
  end
  @counter=0
  @categories.each do |category|
    category.Uploads.each do |upload|
      conversion = Cloudconvert::Conversion.new
      #Tell CloudConvert to get the files
      conversion.convert( "ps", "pdf", "http://#{local_ip}" + upload.upload.url)
      step = conversion.status["step"]
      #Send one file at a time, to keep track
      until (step =~ /error|finished/)
        step = conversion.status["step"]
        puts step
        sleep 1
      end
      @counter += 1
      puts conversion.download_link
      #Add the converted file back into ActiveRecord as a convert
      category.Converts.create(download: conversion.download_link)
    end
  end
end
</pre></li></ul></li>
<li><h3>PDFs are merged into a single PDF, indexed, and served with all files relevant to a user</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>When a user download's a candidate's dossier, he or she receives a single file with all files that fall within his or her scope.</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>The application checks which categories the user owns relevant to the cadidate</li>
<li>The application takes the individual stored PDFs and merges them into a large one</li>
<li>The application creates an index that has the following structure:</li>
<li>Category
<ul><li>File</li>
<li>Page 1</li>
<li>Page 2</li>
<li>File</li>
<li>Page 1</li>
<li>Page 2</li></ul></li>
<li>Category
<ul><li>File</li>
<li>Page 1</li></ul></li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>The indexing needs to be able to retrieve the file names</li>
<li>This is also dependent on other users being able to work within a candidate's scope</li>
<li>This is currently done within a big nasty loop:
<pre>
#Compile with Prawn
def shrimp
  @user=current_user
  @categories=@user.Categories.all
    #Generates the PDF File
  Prawn::Document.generate("public/#{@user.netid}.pdf", {:page_size => 'A4', :skip_page_creation => true}) do |pdf|
    #This tracks the page number
    counter = 1
    #Run through each category
    @categories.each do |category|
      @converts = category.Converts.all
      #Loop through all the converted files in each category
      @converts.each do |pdf_file|
        #Checks if file exists to avoid exception if it doesn't for some reason
        if File.exists?("./public#{pdf_file.download}")
          outline = nil
          #Uses Prawn templates to make the new page
          pdf_temp_nb_pages = Prawn::Document.new(:template => "./public#{pdf_file.download}").page_count
          (1..pdf_temp_nb_pages).each do |i|
            pdf.start_new_page(:template => "./public#{pdf_file.download}", :template_page => i)
            #Updates the outline
            pdf.outline.update do
              if outline == nil #Checks if it's the first page in each document to add a section
                #Creates a section for each new document
                section "#{pdf_file.download}", :destination => counter, :closed => true #do
                outline = 1
              end #END First page check/secion add
            #Creates a marker to each page
            page :destination => counter, :title => "Page #{i}"
            counter +=1
          end #END Outline Update per page
        end #END Make each page
      end #END if File exists
    end #END each converted document
  end #END each category
end #END PDF</pre></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>E-mail Reminders</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Invitation sent when users are registered (Welcome e-mail)</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>Users are sent a link to the application when they are registered</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>A template is stored within the application as a welcome e-mail</li>
<li>This template sends the e-mail to the user based on netid@unm.edu, and includes his or her name</li>
<li>This template will be made editable</li>
<li>The e-mail is sent when a user is registered</li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>This e-mail is sent using Action Mailer and Mandrill.</li>
<li>In order to be editable, we will need to provide the user with an HTML/ERB editor.</li>
<li>This code is called when a user is created:
<pre>
if @user.save
  redirect_to users_path, notice: 'User was successfully created.'
  #Read the categories from the csv file
  categories=SmarterCSV.process('categories.csv')
  categories.each do |c|
    #Create the categories for the candidate
    @user.Categories.create(name: c[:categories])
  end
  Welcome.candidate_mail(recipient: @user).deliver
else
  #Go back to the page if error
  render :new
end
</pre></li></ul></li>
<li><h3>E-mail reminders by date</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>When deadlines are coming up, faculty members are automatically sent e-mail reminders</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>Deadline dates will be saved in the application</li>
<li>The e-mail will be sent to all staff signed up for the application before the deadline</li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>This is dependent on the dates being stored somewhere</li>
<li>The dates can be stored in a CSV (dates.csv) or in the database</li>
<li>This is dependent on the server periodically checking time, perhaps we run some kind of scheduler on the server.</li></ul></li>
<li><h3>E-mail reminders by event</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>E-mails are automatically sent when a user needs to take an action</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>When documents are submitted within the application, the next user in the chain is notified.</li>
<li>The chain looks like this:</li>
<li>Candidate submits dossier >> Department Faculty and Department Admin are notified</li>
<li>Departmin Admin submits letter >> College Admin is notified</li>
<li>College Admin verifies Department process >> College Committee Faculty is notified</li>
<li>College Admin submits letter >> Provost's Admin is notified</li>
<li>Provost's Admin verifies College process >> Provost's Committee Faculty and Senior Vice Provost are notified</li>
<li>These e-mails will be based on templated in the application</li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>Each of these events needs to trigger a mailer</li>
<li>This would be the same event that locks users out of their categories</li>
<li>Something needs to be done about negative decisions</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Archiving</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Long-term storage</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>Stores dossier files for the long-term</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>After the process is complete, the files are moved (right now manually) to long-term storage</li>
<li>The final PDF that was seen at the Provost level, along with materials linked to from the PDF will be included.</li>
<li>A Provost's Admin may save his or her version of the PDF, or a Tech User may be granted a special permission to create the PDF.</li>
<li>This long-term storage will be secure.</li></ul>

<h3>Technical Details:</h3>

<ul><li>Provost's Admins would be best suited to this role, so Tech Users do not have to access privileged information</li>
<li>This long-term storage could be within UNM IT, or on a local hard drive, or in a secure cloud</li>
<li>This archive should have AT LEAST one backup</li></ul></li>
<li><h3>Deleting Files</h3>

<h4>What it does:</h4>

<ul><li>Clears files out of the application and archives</li></ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ul><li>A Provost Admin or specially designated Tech User will delete files (right now manually)</li>
<li>Files may be deleted from the application once they are put into long-term storage</li>
<li>Files may be deleted from long-term storage once a certain length of time has passed</li></ul>

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>

<ul><li>A Tech User may be best suited to this role, as he or she can delete files without being able to view them.</li>
<li>Deleting files from the app may be somehat tricky.</li>
<li>Deleting a candidate from the app currently deletes all files from within his or her categories</li></ul></li>
</ul>
